# Sample BITalino (r)evolution Data 
This repository contains samples of sensor data collected using
BITalino (r)evolution sensors and recorded with OpenSignals
(r)evolution.

Each folder and file name matches the sensor to which the data
corresponds to. Files are provided in both HDF5 (with the internal
structure used in OpenSignals) and standard ASCII TXT files.

All files can be opened and browsed using OpenSignals (r)evolution
(http://bitalino.com/index.php/software), although example Python code
for loading them and a PNG for visual reference are also provided.
